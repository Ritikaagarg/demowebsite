            <b>The Road Not Taken
                -Robert Frost </b>
                <pre>
                    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                    And sorry I could not travel both
                    And be one traveler, long I stood
                    And looked down one as far as I could
                    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
                    
                    Then took the other, as just as fair,
                    And having perhaps the better claim,
                    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                    Though as for that the passing there
                    Had worn them really about the same,
                    
                    And both that morning equally lay
                    In leaves no step had trodden black.
                    Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                    I doubted if I should ever come back.
                    
                    I shall be telling this with a sigh
                    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
                    I took the one less traveled by,
                    And that has made all the difference.
